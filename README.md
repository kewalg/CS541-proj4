Assignment 4 - myShoppingApp

In this assignment, i have made a simple shopping app, that lets new users register and existing users login. The authentication is done from firebase. Once user is verified, he gets access to the menu from where he can add items to the cart as per his/her liking. For the items in the menu, i have implemented the custom listview with checkboxes. To keep a track of the items marked, an array is maintained.
After adding the items, user can place the order on button click.

Following is the summary of the app development:

Day 1: Basic UI implemented.

Day 2: Firebase added for user authentication.

Day 3: Added differnet layouts. Fixed the issue with the firebase not registering new users.

Day 4: Implemented a listview for adding items from menu.

Day 5: Customised the listview for icons and checkboxes. Added cart activity along with clear cart and place order buttons.

Day 6: Added splashscreen and final commit.
